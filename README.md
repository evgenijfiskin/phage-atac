# Custom code repository for PHAGE ATAC

## About

Each folder corresponds to a particular dataset or analysis mode that is presented in this work. Rscripts can be found in the `code` folder that can be executed sequentially to reproduce analyses in part or in whole. Intermediate output files are also hosted for ease of use. 


## Setup

To best use this resource, we recommend pairing with large data files (that are not compatible with github as they exceed 100Mb). These files are available from the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/).

Once one downloads the zip archieve from OSF (~36 Gb), place the extracted folder in the same directory as this repository named `mtscATACpaper_large_data_files` (as shown below). This will enable running custom code to reproduce items in the output folders.
